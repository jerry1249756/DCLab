### Abstract
We implemented Delay-and-sum Beamforming by 16 MEMS microphones (INMP441) which receives sound data via I2S protocol. The delay $\delta_i(p)$ is generated by the module `delta_generator.sv`, which is automated generated by python file. Next, the data will be stored in ring-buffer which provides access to the delayed delta. Next, for each processed data, we can sum these data and squared in `Add_Square.sv`. The data is truncated and stored into SRAM. Finally, VGA will access the data in SRAM and display the intensity on the screen.
